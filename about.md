多看, 多动手, 每个知识点都亲自demo积累

> Fundamentals
> First do it, then do it right, then do it better. This is one fundamental I always keep in mind when developing anything.

> If you're a developer wishing to learn something new, regardless of skill-level, remember that as important as it is to read, it's equally as important to get out there and *do*.

> Create a new gist or JSBin, pop open the console and experiment. It's effing fun.
